# Application Programming Interface - API

## Learning objectives:

1 - RESTful API design

2 - MongoBD and Mongoose

3 - Get more familiar with MVC architecture

4 - Create delete and import scripts to put and take out data on database

5 - And lastly, I combine all the knowledge to write the clean code (implementing tours API).

6 - For professional use, I strongly recommend usage of 'Database As a Service' such as Antlas.

### NOTE: since everything is done on Localhost, I did NOT consider some security issues regarding on environment variables
